# Migration from Figma Make to Standalone

This document outlines the changes made to convert the app from Figma Make to a standalone codebase.

## What Changed

### Removed Figma Make Dependencies
- ✅ Removed "AUTOGENERATED FILE - DO NOT EDIT" comments
- ✅ Updated README with proper project description
- ✅ Cleaned up package.json (name, description, scripts)
- ✅ Updated HTML title
- ✅ Removed Figma Make references from attributions

### Added Standalone Configuration
- ✅ Created `.gitignore` for proper version control
- ✅ Created `vercel.json` for deployment configuration
- ✅ Updated README with deployment instructions

### Branch Created
- ✅ Created `standalone-no-figma` branch to separate from Figma Make version

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Keep in Same Repo (Current Branch)
```bash
# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "Convert to standalone app - remove Figma Make dependencies"

# Push the new branch
git push origin standalone-no-figma

# Make it the main branch (if desired)
git checkout main
git merge standalone-no-figma
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Create New Repository
```bash
# Create a new repo on GitHub
# Then change remote:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tv-scheduler-standalone.git
git push -u origin standalone-no-figma
```

### Option 3: Fork/Clone Fresh
```bash
# Clone current repo to new location
cd /Users/ajvetterco/Desktop/Projects
cp -r Tvscheduler Tvscheduler-standalone
cd Tvscheduler-standalone
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/new-repo-name.git
```

## Deployment

Now you have full control! 

1. **Push to GitHub** → Auto-deploys to your connected service (Vercel/Netlify)
2. **Make changes locally** → No risk of Figma Make overwriting
3. **Deploy independently** → Full CI/CD control

## Benefits

- ✅ No Figma Make conflicts
- ✅ Full code control
- ✅ Independent deployment
- ✅ Can still use Figma for design mockups (just don't sync code)
